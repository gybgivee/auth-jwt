## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer
SEcurity and Easy to use
 The Signature takes the header and the payload's base64 encodes values and hash them with some secret key. This is done so when the key comes in to  back end from the client,then we can first check to see if the payload (which could contain permissions) have note been altered or changed. if they have the hash value of the token would not be the same anymore!
